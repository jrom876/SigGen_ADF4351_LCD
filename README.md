ADF4351 RF Signal Generator Driver for an Arduino LCD Shield

This Arduino code was originally copied from open sources and modified to run in 
my custom frequency generator and amplifier circuit, 
which was used for testing Ground Penetrating Radar Antennae designs (not shown at this time).

This is being shared to help others who wish to use the ADF4351 with an Arduino LCD Shield.

CHEERS!
